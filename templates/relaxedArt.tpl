<h2>
Why Looking at Paintings together?
</h2>
</p>

<p>
It's about empathy. About learning to hear each others voice more and more as we explore three paintings over the course of three weeks.
</p>

<p>
Meetings on:
<br/>
Tuesday 1st May at 7.30 pm
<br/>
Tuesday 8th May at 7.30 pm
<br />
Tuesday 15th May at 7.30 pm
</p>

<p>
Each person in the group will see things differently from others. Will perhaps like or dislike certain aspects of a painting or will have a different memory or experience that might link in some way to the painting. The more I can hear others points of view, the more my own insights and understanding will grow, not only about the painting but perhaps more importantly about my fellow human beings.
</p>

<p>
Firstly each person in the group would briefly describe their immediate impression of the painting. For instance; "this makes me think of a hot summers day in July". Then we would take it in turn to simply describe the bare facts. Eg: "there is a woman wearing a blue dress". Each person would then say something about relationships between and or objects in the painting. Eg: "The Lighthouse looks like it is guiding two boats safely to harbour" or "The woman's cloak is floating round here and it makes me feel that a cloud has floated closer to the earth". 
</p>

<p>
Then we would describe what the painting may remind us of in our own lives. Eg: "I went on a boat trip..." Also we can comment about how the painting makes us feel. Eg: "I like the way such and such" or "such and such makes us feel uncomfortable".
</p>

<p>
And finally what we think/feel/imagine what the intention of the artist might have been.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of discussing a painting in this way is the opposite of presenting what we know. It is to learn about it through each others insights and imagination.
