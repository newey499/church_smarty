<h2>
Christianity Explored
</h2>

 <p>
 Developed over 10 years, 
 <a href="http://www.christianityexplored.com/">Christianity Explored</a>
 is a 10 week course looking at the basics of the Christian faith. 
 </p>

 <p>
 It explores who Jesus was, what his aims were, 
 and what it means to follow him, and gain insight into life's big questions:
<ul type = disc>
<li> What is God like? </li>
<li> Who is Jesus? </li>
<li> Why am I here? </li>
<li> Where am I going? </li>
<li> What happens when I die? </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> 
If you...
<br />
...feel you don't know very much and have lots of questions 
<br />
...are coming back to a faith you have lost
<br />
...don't believe but are curious and want to know why you don't believe
<br />

<p>
Then come and join us.  Ask any questions - simple or difficult - just ask. Or, if you prefer, you can come along and simply listen. You won't be asked to pray, sing, or read aloud.  
</p>

<p>
Starts on Wednesday 2nd October at 7.30 pm at Christ Church Lye.
