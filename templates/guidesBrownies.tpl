  What is guiding?


  Guiding is a game - with a purpose. It provides opportunities for girls and 
	young women to be challenged by new adventures and experiences and achieve
	a sense of pride in accomplishment and teaches them to understand and learn
	about the world, its people and cultures.

  Being a Brownie is all about having loads of fun and a huge adventure! To be
	a Brownie you have just got to be a girl aged between seven and 10 years old.

	Brownies meet together in a Pack most weeks. The Pack is made up of small
	groups called Sixes. 
	A Six is a fab group of friends that has a great time together. 
	You have a special badge to show what Six you belong to.

	The Pack is run by a Guider and a team of adult leaders. 
	They look after you and make sure you have a great time on your Brownie Adventure.
