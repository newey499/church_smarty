<p>
The Food Bank
is an organisation that provides urgently needed food parcels
to those in need.
</p>

<p>
Donations are always welcome and may be left at Christ Church. The type of 
items needed may be found at the 
<a href=\"http://www.blackcountryfoodbank.org.uk/about/\">Food Bank</a>
website
</p>

<p>
Potential users of Food Banks should be aware that it is not possible to simply
present themselves. This is so that Food Banks can concentrate on distributing
food and hygiene items and not get caught up in decisions regarding eligibility.
</p>

<p>
Food Banks require a voucher produced by an independent source. For example a Vicar,
Social Worker, DMBC Care worker, Job Centre and Social Security. 
This list is not exhaustive and many sources of these vouchers are around.
</p>

<p>
The procedure is to ask an appropriate person or organisation for a voucher
and then present the voucher at a food bank that participates in the scheme.
