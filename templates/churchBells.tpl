Thanks to David Chiswell for a detailed progress report and history of the restoration project so far. David's remarks are given below:

<p>

<p>
The local ringing
association have for many years been pestering the previous and
present vicar to get some remedial work done on the bells before they
became unsafe. 
</p>

<p>
During one of his inspections the church architect
noticed that the steel beams supporting the bell frame
were extensively corroded. The DAC bells adviser was asked to inspect
the bells who unsurprisingly reported  exactly what David and myself
had been saying for years - that the bells were becoming unsafe 
and remedial if not restoration work
should be done as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>
 That, briefly summarises how the
restoration poject came into being. 
</p>

<p>
The 

<a href="http://www.wdcra.org.uk/">
Worcestershire & Districts Change Ringing Association
</a>
W&DCRA 
runs a Belfry
Advisory Panel (BAP) of which I am a member. As such we give help and advise in
all matters concerning bells. My involvement with the committee come
about because I have over fifty years ringing experience, I am a time
served maintenance engineer who has been involved with bell
maintenance for almost the same number of years. 
</p<

<p>
The present Vicar (Simon Falshaw) asked if David and I would be prepared to sit on a
committee set up to raise the money required, get quotes from suitable
companies. This we have done.
</p>
<p>
With quotes coming in
at 30 to 35 thousand pounds, any savings that could be made were. 
</p>

<p>
The one big
saving was to do work that did not require the expertise of the bell
hanger, that is removing the bells, cleaning the frame, replacing the steel
grillage under the bell frame and of course helping to put the bells
back in. That basically is what I have agreed to do with the help of
my colleagues from the BAP. 
</p>

<p>
That in a nutshell is what is happening to
get the bells back into working order.
</p>

<p>
To date the following has happened.
<br />

<ul>

<li>
Along with my colleagues we removed the bells
ready for collection by the restorer. 
</li>

<li>
The 
<a href="http://www.christchurchlye.org.uk/index.php?displaypage=church002.php#church_bells">
bells have been taken out
</a>
and sent to 
<a href="http://www.bellhangers.com/">
Matthew Higby
</a> who are the best bell hangers of small bells. He is
currently making new wheels, clappers, headstocks etc for the bells to
be rehung on and replacing all the old fittings with new up to date and
more suitable fittings.
</li> 

<li>
We have also lifted the bell frame from the steel grillage
on one side, removed the old steel beams on that side and replaced
them with new beams that have been galvanised to help stop them from
rusting. 
</li>

<li>
We have now lifted the frame on the other side, removed the
remaining beam and will shortly be inserting the replacement beam.
When this is done the frame will be put back into position and
fastened back down to the new steel grillage. New stainless steel tie
bars will be made to replace the ones that are badly corroded ie all
14 of them. The frame has to be cleaned and wood preservative applied
to it.
</li>


</ul>

</p>

<p>
That should have been the end of my involvement but when we
were making a opening in the ceiling to get the bells out we found
that the ceiling was made out of totally unsuitable material, what was
holding it up was bits of 2x2 nailed to timbers of a dubious quality.
These timbers are also the floor joists to the belfry floor. We are
now awaiting the outcome of a faculty application to replace both the
floor joists and the ceiling.

<h4>History of the Bells</h4>
<p>
Mr. Owen Freeman a public spirited gentleman who served on the Burial Board, was on the the Board of Orchard Lane school and a Committee member of Lye Institute. He was manager of George King-Harrison's brick works in Dudley Road which became the site of Folkes Forge and now Folkes Trading Estate.
</p>

<p>
He was responsible for the original installation of the Bells which were manufactured by and purchased from 
<a href="http://www.gcna.org/data/IXfoundryVanaerschodt.html">
Severin Van Aerschodt
</a>

 of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leuven#History">
Leuven
</a>


Belgium
</p>

<p>
The eight bells are amongst the lightest in the world as far as Church or Tower Bells are concerned, therefore of great historical value and should be cherished and preserved.
</p>



<p>
The largest Bell weighs 3.5cwt (180Kgs), the smallest ways 0.75cwt (35Kgs). 
Each of the bells is named after a Christian virtue.
<br />
<br />

<h4>Why do we need the Bells</h4>
<p>
Change ringing in the present form is an ancient art which has been carried out for about 400 hears but bells have called the faithful to worship for many years before that.
</p>
<p>
Bells aid us in our worship of God. They call us to services. They peal joyfully on wedding days and on the great feast days of the Church.
</p>
<p>
They toll mournfully as the departed receive the Church's last blessing.
</p>
<p>
The sweet voices of the Bells direct our hearts toward God and draw us to Church to experience the presence of Christ, to listen to the word of God and to offer our prayers.
</p>


<h4>What needs to be done</h4>
<p>
The bells have to be dismantled and transported to the bellhangers. Thet then need work done to their crowns and clappers. New headstocks have to be made and fitted. New bearings fitted to headstocks and heavy steel bedplates made. New light wheels will be manufactured from English Oak and Ash. New Ash stays and clappers fitted.
</p>
<p>
They would then possibly be cleaned and tuned to further improve their tone.
</p>
<p>
The bells would then be transported back to the Church and with the help of volunteers hoisted into the tower and hung on new bedplates.
</p>

<p>
<b>This work will cost in the region of 40,000 gbp</b>
</p>
